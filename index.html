        MOVE//AI is an intelligent performance coach that helps basketball players move better, stay healthy, 
        and perform at their peak — using only their phone camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        It studies how players jump, cut, and land — recognizing subtle movement shifts that reveal fatigue, stiffness, or imbalance. 
        When it detects an issue, it gives clear, personal advice — from quick stretches to targeted drills.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t replace coaches. It amplifies them — helping every athlete perform at their best, every day.
