    <div class="about">
      <p>
        MOVE//AI watches every jump, cut, and landing. Through your phone camera,
        it reads micro-shifts in form and flexibility—changes so small that even
        the best trainers miss them in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When fatigue or imbalance appears—tight hips, uneven landings, restricted
        angles—MOVE//AI reacts instantly. It serves precise, personal fixes:
        mobility drills, micro-stretches, and form resets.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t replace coaches. It empowers them. It translates motion into
        readable insight, keeping players healthy, explosive, and unstoppable.
